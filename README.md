# Armut ARL Recommender


## Business Problem
Armut, the largest online service platform in Turkey, brings together service providers and those who want to receive services. It enables easy access to services such as cleaning, renovation, and transportation with just a few touches on a computer or smartphone. Using the dataset that includes users who have received services and the categories of these services, an association rule learning based product recommendation system is aimed to be created.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the services purchased by the customers and their categories. It includes the date and time information of each service received.
